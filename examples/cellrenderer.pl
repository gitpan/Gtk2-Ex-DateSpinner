# Usage: ./cellrenderer.pl
#
# This example uses Gtk2::Ex::DateSpinner::CellRenderer to display and edit
# a date column in a TreeModel.
#
# As usual the model/view/renderer stuff is diabolically complicated, but
# assuming you've managed to display stuff, the editing is then a matter of
# enabling 'editable' in the renderer and hooking onto its 'edited' signal.
# Writing the new data back to the model or to disk or wherever is the
# responsibility of that handler.
#
# The code here is basically the same as you'd do for a plain
# Gtk2::CellRendererText.  But DateSpinner::CellRenderer edits with a
# DateSpinner popup.  The $newstr string passed to the 'edited' signal is
# the new ISO YYYY-MM-DD date.
#
# You can generate the 'editable' setting on the renderer by all the usual
# model+viewer tricks, like getting it from a column or setting it with a
# data func according to the phase of the moon.  That way you can have some
# cells editable and some not.
#
# The text column added here is just for decoration, but you could make it
# editable too.  You can even have multiple renderers in the one column,
# each editable.  The choice between one column with two renderers and two
# columns with a renderer each is only really a matter of how you want stuff
# to line up and column headings, resizing, reordering etc.
